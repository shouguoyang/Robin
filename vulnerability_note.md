In the experiment, we manually analysis the candidates with -1.0 score (e.g. reported by sanity checker). We detect 15 candidates that have vulnerable behaviours, which are listed in above table.
The first column specifies the CVEs that are used to generate the MFI and find the candidates.
The second and third columns specify the versions and candidate function names, which has the similarity score -1.0.
The fourth column specifies whether the function has been reported as the CVE already.
The last column gives the file names and the line numbers of the vulnerable point after manual examination.
From the table, we can notice that only 3 candidates have been discovered before. The rest 12 cases have the vulnerable behaviour when given the inputs in the signature.
For example, function RSA_check_key has -1.0 score when matching with the signature of CVE-2015-0289. The source code of function RSA_check_key is listed below.

## Source Code of **RSA_check_key**
```
int RSA_check_key(const RSA *key)
{
  BIGNUM *i, *j, *k, *l, *m;
  BN_CTX *ctx;
  int r;
  int ret = 1;

  if (!key->p || !key->q || !key->n || !key->e || !key->d) {
      RSAerr(RSA_F_RSA_CHECK_KEY, RSA_R_VALUE_MISSING);
      return 0;
  	 }
```

It performs pointer dereferences without a null pointer detection at code `if (!key->p || !key->q || !key->n || !key->e || !key->d)`.
We also verify one of its callers also does not perform null pointer detection.
Attackers can leverage the dereferences to manipulate the contents of the memory to break the system.
